# QLC_config




## Fixtures 
Go into C:\Users\USERNAME\QLC+\Fixtures\ by default, but I think you can just import them from this directory 


## Styles 
Location C:\Users\USERNAME\QLC+
The default one is ok. It's a bit bright to run a show with. 
The custom one is built off the RJones one I think. It is better to run a show (and matches the web one in colours) but results in the loss of some menu tabs adjusting fixtures or something like that - it needs more work. 


## Shows / projects 
### Full Mine 
All my lights, and a set-up virtual conole 
- single primary, 
- 2 RGB fills 
- UV (no patterns)

Midi mapped, can be used for photos

### Shibari Sydney
The one from shibari sydney is here .  it has several things that should be improved 

- [ ] single colour for fill / uplighting 
- [ ] clean up all functions / make sure they work 
- [ ] simplify the tap 
- [ ] add a physical midi controller

### Adelaide Fringe 
- UV only 



## Creating shortcuts on windows
- Create the shortcut 
- change the target to `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c "SET QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1 && START /D ^"C:\QLC+^" qlcplus.exe -w -o C:\Users\<PROJECT_PATH>"`

## Midi Controller 
- Only works on windows.
- 


## Smoke 
green light is ready. 
Note  - DMX Address on machine is backwards. 
Set switch 10 to off. 
Set the switch you want to OFF 

Control via the remote?? 
Does work. Set it, and it follows. 
Seems to override the back? 
May overrride as soon as the control is plugged in??
