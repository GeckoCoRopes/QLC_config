Program on windows - the mac one seems a bit unstable. Could be the hub though ... 



## Windows 

Get program from worlde.com.cn > Downloads > look for easy control 

- Open program 
- load the config from here  / read back from controller 
- modify as needed 
- for each page 
  - Communication > Send scene data > Press OK, await completion 

Suggest keeping the config here up to date to avoid having to redo everything. 


## Changes 

The only changes so far are to make the 2 buttons next to the pages one send to different channels on each page. 
Have verified that the toggle does work. Will struggle in solo frames in QLC, but otherwise may be useful. 

Have set the first several buttons to toggle. 
Pages are buggy - page 3/4 often program wrong.
